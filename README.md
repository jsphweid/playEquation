# playEquation

Uses [fooPlot](https://github.com/dheera/fooplot) primarly to take an equation, generate a 2-second PCM WAV file at 44.1k and plays it back in the browser.

## Dev Environment

`git clone https://github.com/jsphweid/playEquation.git` to clone to directory

`npm install` to download dependencies

`http-server` to serve up the app

`grunt js-hint` to jshint on '/js' files and `grunt html-hint` to root html files (index.html)

`grunt build` to make production build to '/build' folder


## TODO
- update directory here to be in 'src' folder and redo the corresponding Gruntfile.js parts
